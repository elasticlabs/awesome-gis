This folder contains some resources and hacky python code that will read the contents of [The Awesome GIS repository README.md](https://github.com/elasticlabs/awesome-gis/blob/master/README.md), and extract all the links (between '#start-here' and '#end' to a .html file that you can load into your browser)

**Depends on**:
* `requests`
* `beautifulsoup 4`

See the example html files as example output.
